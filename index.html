        <h2>4th of July Cake</h2>
        <p>
          Below is a vanilla cake I made for the 4th of July. It has a whipped
          cream icing with strawberries and blueberries in the middle and on top
          for decoration. It is a great choice for summer when you want
          something light and fresh. I shared it with my co-workers and they
          really enjoyed it.

        <h2>Fruity Pebbles Marshmallow Cookies</h2>
        <p>
          Below are some cookies I made just for fun. I love fruity pebbles
          cereal and thought it would be cool to use them in cookies. The icing
          includes marshmallow fluff. It turned out to be a great combination.
          This batch didn't make it long enough to share with others!

        <h2>Pumpkin Pie</h2>
        <p>
          Below is a pumpkin pie I made for Thanksgiving one year. The crust is
          homemade, and I added a leaf on top for some decoration. The family
          really enjoyed it! I am the designated dessert maker for Thanksgiving
          and had to make two pies the following year!

        <h2>Lemon Blueberry Cheesecake</h2>
        <p>
          Below is lemon blueberry cheesecake I made as a birthday cake. It has
          blueberry swirls and a lemon base with a graham cracker crust.
          Cheesecakes can be tricky to bake, but this one turned out to be just
          right thankfully!
